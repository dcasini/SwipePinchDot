# SwipePinchDot

This is a project I created to use gestures on iOS. This must be run on a real device, not a simulator.
Uses swipe gesture to move the red dot vertically or horizontally on the screen (the dot will roll off one side and come back in on the other side)
Uses pinch gesture to change the size of the dot.
